1. Taxa summary plots Comparison of microbiomes across study cohorts 
	1. Trios
		1. LC
		2. MC
		3. square root jensen shannon 
	2. Long term 
		1. LC 
		2. MC 
	3. Baseline
		1. "LC " which is actually fecal pellets 
2. Only include long term and baseline if there are beta diversity and 
3. Go with what works for Trios 
	1. see if Long Term and Baseline have agreements when using SQRT Jensen Shannon dissimilarity method 
	2. see if Long Term and Baseline have agreeing taxa at the q<0.25 level 
		1. attempt to include litter 
		2. wrangle the litter data for the Baseline mice 
			1. C57Bl6/J mice vs C57Bl6/N mice from Taconic 
			2. Remove Taconic and see what happens 
4. Trios and Long term and Baseline
	1. Metal-associated enzymes or pathways


Figure 1. Show all trace metals. See if ratios look better (ug Metal for Luminal / ug Metal for Mucosal per Mouse) Hold back Selenium

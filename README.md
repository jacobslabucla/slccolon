# slccolon
This repository contains the original count data and analysis files used to produce the figures in the paper.

## Steps to Reproduce the Figures 
1. First, clone the repo. 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jacobslabucla/slccolon
```
2. Then, open the `Rproj_slccolonpaper` folder. Go to `Final_Figures_Paper`.

3. Run everything in `Functions.R` first. 

4. Now, by running each Figure script (matches the Figures in the paper) you should be able to reproduce the figures in the paper.
